# Python-Reference
Some handy images, charts and documents for developing with Python

The Tkinter module documentation is mainly just for my own reference, but if you get use out of them that is good
Most of the tkinter information I found on effbot.org and have used that page a few times for information.

I only really upload the things that I personally use, so it may appear unorganised. I am planning on putting 
some of the material into office docs / PDF format, just for organization - so one individual document for all of 
the tkinter widgets etc
